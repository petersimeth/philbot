## A framework for implementing strategies using TD Ameritrade's API.

### Use info
Sensitive account info should be stored in a .env file in the root directory. The program will also generate a token.json in the root directory. Both of these should be git ignored.

The .env file should be of the form
```
account_number = "xxx" 
account_password = "xxx"  
client_id = "xxx" 
```
